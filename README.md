# textEncryptionDecryption

In this I have made use of Python library Base64 and for GUI, I have made use of Tkinter.

Base64 encoding transforms binary data into text format so that it can be properly handled by a user across a communication channel. Base64 is primarily utilized in the email encryption process and is also known as Privacy enhanced Electronic mail (PEM).

There is a Python module named BASE64 that has the following two main functions:

=>  It decodes the input value parameter supplied and stores the decoded output as an object using the base64.decode(input, output) function.

=>  Base64.encode(input, output) stores the decoded output as an object and encodes the input value supplied by the input parameter.

The default GUI library for Python is called Tkinter. The combination of Python and Tkinter makes it quick and simple to develop GUI apps. An effective object-oriented interface for the Tk GUI toolkit is provided by Tkinter.

It's simple to build a GUI application using Tkinter. All you have to do is carry out the actions listed below:

=>  Tkinter module import.

=>  Make the GUI program's primary window.

=>  Add a widget from the list above or more to the GUI program.

=>  To respond to each event that the user has caused, enter the main event loop.
